# Personality-Prediction
The organization needs to classify the individuals based on their personality traits. The availability of high dimensional and large amounts of data has paved the way for increasing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by targeting specific people. This will increase the popularity and attractiveness of products and services. Some common examples:

Personalizing the online advertisement campaigns.
Incorporate a personality-based approach to increase the attractiveness of recommended products.
Personality-based adaptations can also provide personalized visualization and better music recommendations.
In this project, we will use machine learning to evaluate the MBTI's validity and ability to predict language styles and behavior online.

As a next step, we will use 
## Feature Engineering:
Convert the text data into numerical features that machine learning models can understand. 
## Label Encoding:
Encode the categorical MBTI personality types into numerical labels. For example, convert "INFP" to 1,
"ENFJ" to 2, and so on.
## Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. 
## Model Selection:
Choose a machine learning model suitable for text classification tasks. Common choices include logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and neural networks
## Model Training:
Train the selected model on the training dataset using the prepared text features and the corresponding MBTI labels.
